# Sorting Algorithms

This is a project for Algorithms and Data Structure class at the Factulty of Electrical Engineering
at Warsaw University of Technology.

## Goal
The goal was to implement three sorting algorithms:
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Quick Sort (iterative, for arrays of size 10 or less uses InSort)

Each of the implemented algorithms was to be tested, and their execution time was to be measured for growing arrays
with worst and best case scenarios (where applicable).

## Results
All the data is stored in CSV files (tab separated) in the `./complexity` directory.
Furthermore, that directory contains a file `complexity.xlsx` in which stored are graphs representing ratio of
execution time and array length for each sorting algorithm.
